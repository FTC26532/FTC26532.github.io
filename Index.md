Our haptics sensors are no bigger than 2 inches but they a very powerful vibration that stimulate the feeling of being there live!==

# Why You Should Buy

**We have noticed a big problem around entertainment and sports media. Sports and music concerts are way too expensive. The average Taylor Swift concert ticket is a whopping 1011 US dollars. On the other hand, sports tickets cost more money then most of us can fathom. Why would you need to be spending those ridiculous prices for one experience when you can spend way less money for many, many more experiences. Not only do our products make you able to feel like you are there in person, you also can experience these amazing events with your friends and family because of our Haptic Linking system through our different products. Now that you know why you should buy them subscribe to our blog so you can be the first to get you hands on a Haptic vest. Stop dreaming about watching and experiencing a concert or the world cup soccer final today and start enjoying them tomorrow.**

## Sporting Events

==Watching sports on TV is fun but it is much less of an experience than going to a real game. Our haptic suits can connect with live players heartbeats at live games and sporting events.==

## Concerts

==Another mode of our haptic suits is to be sound reactive. This means you will be able to feel the music without having to have speakers that are bigger than you are!==
