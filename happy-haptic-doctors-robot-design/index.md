There are two main parts that you need to focus on for FLL. The first part is the **Innovation Project**, which is a solution to address a real world issue. For example, our innovation project is a n immersive haptic suit that allows people to experience concerts and live sporting events from the comfort of their home, at a fraction of the price.

The second part is **Robot Design**, which describes the parts of our robot.

### The Arm Attachment

The arm is an attachment that attaches to the front motor and can press things down or lift levers up. We use it for:
- Immersive experience
- The lever on the rolling camera mission
- To push the rolling camera
- To push over our wall to do 3D cinema

### Sound Mixer Attachment

Another attachment we have is for the sound mixer. It has three extending mechanisms to push the sound mixer levers up. We also have a hooking piece on the side which picks up one of the experts.
