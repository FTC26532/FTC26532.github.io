# 2024 Worlds
The New Hampshire state competition had 46 teams competing, and [our team](../our-team/index.html) got first place! Since we won, we earned an invitation to the [2024 FIRST Championship](https://www.firstchampionship.org/), in Houston, April 17-20. For worlds, we are trying to patent our innovation project and upgrade our robot from EV3 to SPIKE to improve the robot.

## Competition Categories

1. **Robot Game**: Complete missions on the challenge board. This portion of the game seems like the main focus, but it isn’t the whole competition.
2. **Robot Design**: Present to judges about how your robot works, the inspiration, different iterations, and why it works well.
3. **Innovation Project**: Find and present about a solution to a real world problem in your community based on the year's theme.
4. **Core Values**: The most important category, showing teamwork and innovation. Our team got 100% in every category for core values!
