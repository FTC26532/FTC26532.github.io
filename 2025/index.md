The New Hampshire state FTC competition had over 30 teams competing, and [our team](../our-team/index.html) won alliance captain 2nd place! Since we acheived 2nd, we earned an invitation to the 2025 FTC New England Premier, in West Springfield, Massachusetts, in April.

## Competition Categories

1. **Robot Game**: Complete missions on the challenge board. This game seems like the main focus, but it isn’t the whole competition.
2. **Robot Design**: A presentation to tell judges about how your robot works, the inspiration, different interations, and why it works well.

Unlike FLL, FTC only contains 2 main judged categories, Robot Game and Robot Design. Each year, the Robot Game, there's different theme and challenges to complete and gain points. For Robot design, you will present to judges about your robot and how the different mechanisms work.
